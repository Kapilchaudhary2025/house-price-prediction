# House Price Prediction by Kapil

A machine learning project to predict house prices using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn, completed as part of my internship at ONLEI Technologies.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Predict the sale price of houses based on various features using regression models.

## 📁 Dataset

- [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- Download `train.csv` and place it in the `data/` folder.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Steps

1. **Data Exploration (EDA)**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)**
4. **Model Evaluation**
5. **(Optional) Streamlit App Deployment**

## 📝 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kapilchaudhary2025/house-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place `train.csv` in the `data/` folder.
4. Open the notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA_and_Modeling.ipynb
    ```
